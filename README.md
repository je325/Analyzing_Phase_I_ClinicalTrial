# Clinical Trial Analysis Project
Analyzing Phase I Clinical Trial
This Jupyter notebook contains Python code that analyzes data from a Phase I clinical trial. The notebook addresses the following key questions.

1. **Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events:** Summarizes the frequency and severity of adverse events observed during Phase I of a clinical trial.
2. **Dose-Related Trends in Adverse Events:** Investigates whether there are any dose-related trends in the occurrence or severity of adverse events among participants in the trial.
3. **Recommendations for proceeding to Phase II Clinical Trials:** Provides recommendations for proceeding to Phase II of the clinical trial based on the analysis of Phase I data. (Example external research and insights are incorporated to support these recommendations for our sample case).
